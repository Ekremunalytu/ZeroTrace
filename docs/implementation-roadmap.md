## ðŸš§ Risk Mitigation & Learning Strategy

### High Risk Areas:
1. **C++ Complexity**: Multiple OS APIs, threading, performance
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, incremental complexity, extensive testing
   
2. **Microservices Coordination**: Service discovery, message routing
   - **Mitigation**: Well-defined interfaces, comprehensive logging
   
3. **Performance at Scale**: 1000+ events/minute across multiple services
   - **Mitigation**: Early benchmarking, async processing, optimization

4. **Security Implementation**: Crypto, secure storage, privilege management
   - **Mitigation**: Security-first design, code reviews, testing

### Learning Schedule (Progressive):
- **Months 1-2**: Docker, databases, message queues, basic architecture
- **Months 3-4**: C++ systems programming, Python async, file systems
- **Months 5-6**: Process monitoring, Windows/Linux APIs, threat detection
- **Months 7-8**: Network programming, protocol analysis, traffic monitoring
- **Months 9-10**: Correlation algorithms, ML basics, advanced UI development

### Backup Plans:
- If C++ too complex â†’ Start with Python prototypes, port later
- If performance insufficient â†’ Add caching, optimize algorithms
- If microservices too complex â†’ Consolidate services temporarily
- If timelines slip â†’ Focus on core EPP features first
