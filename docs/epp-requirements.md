- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks

### 2. Hash-Based Detection
- **Requirement**: Check files against malware hash database
- **Implementation**: Python service with PostgreSQL lookup
- **Priority**: HIGH  
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks
- **Status**: Database schema ready ✅

### 3. YARA Signature Scanning
- **Requirement**: Scan files with YARA rules
- **Implementation**: Python service with yara-python

- **Status**: Database schema ready ✅

### 4. Threat Response Engine
- **Requirement**: Automated response to threats (quarantine/block)
- **Implementation**: Python orchestration service
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time**: 2 weeks

### 5. Basic Management Interface
- **Requirement**: View alerts, manage quarantine
- **Implementation**: FastAPI + Simple web UI

- Network-based protection
- Advanced correlation

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Detect file creation events in real-time
- [ ] Identify known malware by hash (>99% accuracy)
- [ ] Scan files with YARA rules (<5 second scan time)
- [ ] Quarantine malicious files automatically
- [ ] Generate alerts for security events
- [ ] Provide basic management interface

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance**: <100ms file scan time for files <10MB
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime for core services
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ file events per minute
- **Security**: All communications encrypted (TLS)
- **Usability**: One-click deployment with make/docker

- YARA scanner service (Python)
- Rule management system
- Enhanced event correlation

### Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10): Response & UI
- Threat response engine (Python)
- Quarantine system
- Basic web interface

### Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12): Integration & Testing
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

```
File Events → File Monitor → RabbitMQ → Detection Services → Database
                                            ↓
                                       Response Engine
                                            ↓
                                    Quarantine/Block Action
```

## 📋 Acceptance Tests

1. **File Creation Detection**: Create a file, verify event generated within 1 second
2. **Malware Detection**: Copy known malware hash, verify alert generated  
3. **YARA Detection**: Create file matching YARA rule, verify scan result
4. **Quarantine**: Trigger quarantine action, verify file moved to secure location
5. **UI Integration**: View alerts in web interface, manage quarantine files

## 📈 Success Metrics

- Time to detect: <1 second for file events
- False positive rate: <1% for hash detection
- Scan performance: >100 files/minute
- System impact: <5% CPU usage
- Memory footprint: <512MB total
